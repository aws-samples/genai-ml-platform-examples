    "# Evaluate Langfuse Traces using an external evaluation pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An external evaluation pipeline is useful when you need:\n",
    "- More control over when traces get evaluated. You could schedule the pipeline to run at specific times or responding to event-based triggers like Webhooks.\n",
    "- Greater flexibility with your custom evaluations, when your needs go beyond whatâ€™s possible with the Langfuse UI\n",
    "- Version control for your custom evaluations\n",
    "- The ability to evaluate data using existing evaluation frameworks and pre-defined metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn to implement a external evaluation pipeline by doing the following:\n",
    "1. Create a synthetic dataset to test your models.\n",
    "2. Use the Langfuse client to gather and filter traces of previous model runs\n",
    "3. Evaluate these traces offline and incrementally\n",
    "4. Add scores to existing Langfuse traces\n",
