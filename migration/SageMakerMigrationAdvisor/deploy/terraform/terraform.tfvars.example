# Example Terraform Variables Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your values

# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"
app_name   = "sagemaker-migration-advisor"

# Security: IP Whitelisting
# Replace with your IP address in CIDR notation
# Find your IP: curl ifconfig.me
my_ip_address = "0.0.0.0/0"  # WARNING: Change this to your IP for security (e.g., "203.0.113.0/32")

# ECS Task Configuration
ecs_task_cpu      = "1024"  # 1 vCPU (256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096)
ecs_task_memory   = "2048"  # 2 GB (512, 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120, 6144, 7168, 8192)
ecs_desired_count = 1       # Number of tasks to run

# HTTPS Configuration (Optional)
# Uncomment and set these to enable HTTPS

# Option 1: CloudFront HTTPS (No custom domain needed) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
# enable_cloudfront = true

# Option 2: ALB HTTPS with Custom Domain (Requires domain ownership)
# certificate_arn = "<YOUR_ACM_CERTIFICATE_ARN>"
# domain_name     = "advisor.yourdomain.com"

# Tags
tags = {
  Application = "SageMaker Migration Advisor"
  ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  Deployment  = "ECS-Fargate"
  Environment = "Production"
}

# ============================================
# Configuration Examples
# ============================================

# Example 1: HTTP Only (Default)
# - Just set aws_region, my_ip_address, and other basic settings
# - Don't set certificate_arn
# - Access via: http://your-alb-dns-name.region.elb.amazonaws.com

# Example 2: HTTPS with ALB DNS Name
# certificate_arn = "<YOUR_ACM_CERTIFICATE_ARN>"
# - HTTP automatically redirects to HTTPS
# - Access via: https://your-alb-dns-name.region.elb.amazonaws.com
# - Certificate must be valid for ALB DNS or use wildcard

# Example 3: HTTPS with Custom Domain
# certificate_arn = "<YOUR_ACM_CERTIFICATE_ARN>"
# domain_name     = "advisor.yourdomain.com"
# - Requires Route53 hosted zone for the domain
# - Creates DNS A record automatically
# - Access via: https://advisor.yourdomain.com
